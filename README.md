Project Overview: Comparing Stock Market Performance

Objective:
The objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stock market performance of three major US companies from 2018 to 2023â€”providing valuable insights for potential investors looking to make informed decisions.

Scope:
The analysis encompassed key stock market metrics, including open price, closing price, volume, and stock price. Additionally, the performance of the three companies was compared against the S&P 500 index.

Methodology:
The project utilized a statistical approach, employing descriptive analysis and linear regression techniques. Data analysis and visualization were conducted exclusively in Microsoft Excel.

Key Focus Areas:
Stock Price: Assessing the overall price dynamics of the stocks.
Open Price: Examining the starting value of stocks for each company.
Closing Price: Evaluating the final value of stocks at the end of trading sessions.
Volume: Analysing the total number of shares traded during a specific period.
Comparison with S&P 500: Evaluating the relative performance of the three companies against the broader market.

Outcome:
The project generated valuable insights into the stock market dynamics of the selected companies, including a comparative analysis with the S&P 500. Findings were effectively communicated in a PowerPoint presentation (see Stock Market Analysis.pdf), leveraging descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis. This presentation aids potential investors in assessing market conditions and making informed investment decisions.
